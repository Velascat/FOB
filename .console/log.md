# Log

## 2026-05-19 — Removed live kodo/archon references from src

Updated watcher_status_pane.py docstring (kodo → executor campaigns). Updated
demo.py YAML example (kodo: section → team_executor:, binary: kodo → team-executor).
Updated providers.py backend entry (kodo → team_executor with TeamExecutor install URL).

## 2026-05-13 — WorkStation → PlatformDeployment hard cutover

- Updated `README.md` and `docs/history/` to replace all `WorkStation`/`workstation` references with `PlatformDeployment`/`platformdeployment`.

## 2026-05-12 — Expand platform profile to RepoGraph and ProtocolWarden docs

Added `RepoGraph` and `ProtocolWarden.github.io` to the tracked `platform`
profile so the platform watcher and lazygit multi-repo view include both repos
by default. Aligned the profile docs and demo wording to the new platform set.

## 2026-05-12 — Remove WorkStation profile fallback

Updated the platform group to target `PlatformDeployment` directly, removed the
tracked `workstation.yaml` profile, and removed `WorkStation` fallback lookup
from the providers/demo/workers paths so the interactive git watcher and
platform commands resolve the deployment repo by its canonical name only.

## 2026-05-10 — Codex startup defaults to full access

Updated OperatorConsole's Codex launcher to start Codex panes with
`-a never -s danger-full-access` by default, matching the full-access operator
session profile. Profiles can still opt out with `codex.approval_mode: ""` or
`codex.sandbox_mode: ""`. Added startup tests for the default and opt-out paths.

## 2026-05-08 — Add .env.example

OperatorConsole reads 7 env vars (CONSOLE_PROFILE, PORT_SWITCHBOARD,
OPERATIONS_CENTER_*, ZELLIJ, ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME) but had no documented
reference. Added .env.example with all vars commented out and explained.

_Chronological continuity log. Decisions, stop points, what changed and why._
_Not a task tracker — that's backlog.md. Keep entries concise and dated._

- 2026-05-12 — RepoGraph boundary artifact wiring tightened to file-only: the
  custodian audit path now materializes `REPOGRAPH_BOUNDARY_ARTIFACT_FILE` from a
  source locator before invoking Custodian, and the remaining deployment-facing
  templates were aligned to `PlatformDeployment` naming.

- Wire queue plumbing contract (2026-05-08, on chore/queue-plumbing-contract): Added `audit.plumbing` to `.custodian/config.yaml` for the queue artifact (OperatorConsole writes `~/.console/queue/<uuid>.json`, OC intake reads it). P1/P2/P3 all 0 findings live.

- Wire cross_repo config (2026-05-08, on chore/wire-cross-repo-config): Added `audit.cross_repo.platform_manifest_repo: ../PlatformManifest` to `.custodian/config.yaml`. Enables X1/X2/X3 detectors; live run shows 0 findings.

- codex --full-auto → -a never (2026-05-08, on fix/codex-full-auto): codex dropped --full-auto. Updated bootstrap.py default approval_mode to `-a never`; same fix applied to kodo sessions/codex.py, orchestrators/codex_cli.py, and benchmark/runner.py in that repo.

- Banner padding equalized and trimmed (2026-05-08, on fix/banner-equal-padding): Equalized lp and g to the same value, then trimmed 15% — both now `max(4, (w-1)*17//80)` (= (w-1)//4 × 0.85). At 120 cols: 25 spaces each side.

- Banner padding unified at half original (2026-05-08, on fix/banner-half-padding): Both single and multi-banner now use lp=(w-1)//4 and g=max(6,(w-1)//6) — half the original multi-banner values. Removes the single/multi branch entirely.

- Banner single-loop padding at half size (2026-05-08, on fix/banner-single-padding): Single-banner re-stream gets lp=(w-1)//4 and g=max(6,(w-1)//6) — half the original values — so there's a visible breath between loops. Multi-banner keeps lp="" and g="    " (4 spaces); the crossfade coloring is the boundary signal there.

- Banner padding stripped (2026-05-08, on fix/banner-strip-padding): Removed leading pad (`(w-1)//2` spaces) and large gap (`max(12, (w-1)//3)` spaces) from `_build_unit` and `_banner_unit_len`. Both cases now use a fixed 4-space separator between units — the tape streams the next banner in seamlessly so the large pads were dead space.

- Multi-banner cycling system + white-on-red fix (2026-05-08, on feat/multi-banner-cycle): The single-purpose stall banner becomes a 4-level banner system. CRITICAL (white on red — fixes the previous black-on-red look from A_REVERSE), WARNING (white on yellow), INFO (white on cyan), HEALTHY (white on green). Conditions: CRITICAL = stall / SwitchBoard offline / resource gate at cap or below RAM floor. WARNING = backend at concurrency cap / queue depth ≥ 10 / free RAM within 1.2× of gate floor. INFO = first 30s after launch (readings stabilizing). HEALTHY = nothing else. Worst-first sort; cycle index advances every 15 frames (3s at 200ms tick); marquee restarts when cycling. Counter shown on banner when count > 1 ([N/M]). Banner block always renders so layout stays stable; middle_top fixed at 7. 8 new tests in TestBannerConditions; 26 watcher tests passing.

- Banner + footer divider lines (2026-05-08, on feat/banner-and-footer-dividers): Two visual changes. Top: when stall banner is up, layout becomes divider/marquee/divider/blank/title (was marquee/blank/title/blank/divider) — the two dividers frame the alert as its own block. Bottom: footer block now divider/hints/divider going up from the bottom edge (was just hints), with the existing trailing blank from System Resources sitting above the upper divider. Flash floats above the upper divider when present. middle_top=5 with banner / 3 without; footer_h=4 with flash / 3 without.

- Gate readout counts RAM + swap; title→section spacer (2026-05-08, on `feat/gate-readout-ram-plus-swap-and-spacer`): The `Global gate` row in System Resources now sums free RAM + free swap when comparing to `min_available_memory_mb`, matching the OC `UsageStore.available_memory_mb()` change shipping in OC PR #115. Cell label updated to `mem≥XMB (Y free, ram+swap)` so operators see the unit. Also bumps `middle_top` by one row so the first section visually detaches from the title/separator above it (no banner: title row 0 → sep row 1 → blank row 2 → first section row 3; banner: marquee row 0 → blank row 1 → title row 2 → sep row 3 → blank row 4 → first section row 5).

- Watcher polish: streaming banner, blank spacers, status-colored headers (2026-05-08, on `feat/global-resource-gate-readout-and-collapsed-default`): Three follow-ups landed alongside the resource-gate work. **Streaming stall banner**: when one or more roles' heartbeats go stale, the banner now scrolls horizontally as a marquee — `banner_offset` advances 2 chars per frame and the pane drops its tick from 500ms → 200ms while the banner is up. A blank spacer row sits between the banner and the `Operations Center` title so they don't crowd. **System Resources spacers**: blank lines added at the top (between separator and title) and bottom of the bottom-anchored block so it visually detaches from neighboring content. **Status-colored section headers**: each section's header now reflects the section's worst state — `Execution budget` and `Backend caps` propagate the worst row's color (red ≥100% / yellow ≥80% / green); `Services` colors the header by the SwitchBoard up/down flag; `Queue` reflects backlog size (red ≥10, yellow ≥5, green otherwise).

- Global resource gate readout + collapsed-by-default sections (2026-05-08, on `feat/global-resource-gate-readout-and-collapsed-default`): Two changes to the curses status pane. **Resource gate**: new `_resource_gate()` collector reads `resource_gate:` block from `operations_center.local.yaml` (parses `max_concurrent` + `min_available_memory_mb` with the same lightweight indented-block parser used by `_backend_caps`). The System Resources block now renders a `Global gate` row showing `in_flight N/M` (sum of all-backend in-flight from `backend_usage`) and `ram≥XXMB (Y free)`; line goes red when concurrency is at cap or free RAM is below the floor, yellow at ≥80% concurrency, green when under. When neither field is set, renders `(unset) — config: resource_gate.* in OC local.yaml` so operators see the feature exists. **Initial collapsed state**: all 9 collapsible sections (roles, active, recent, board, campaigns, queue, budget, backend_caps, services) start collapsed; operators expand what they need via click-on-header or `c`. System Resources is bottom-anchored, not part of the collapsible set, so it stays visible. 3 new tests for the gate parser + 18 watcher tests passing; ruff clean.

- Add PlatformManifest to platform group + watcher (2026-05-08, on `feat/add-platform-manifest-to-platform-group`): Tenth public platform repo joins the workspace. New `config/profiles/platformmanifest.yaml` mirrors the rxp/sourceregistry shape (lazygit + bash panes, pytest -q + ruff helpers). `config/profiles/platform.yaml` group list grew from 9 → 10. `.gitignore` allowlist updated. The git-dirty watcher reads its repo set from the loaded profile group at launcher.py:132 so no code change required — adding to platform.yaml is sufficient. All 10 group members validate cleanly via `validate_profile`.


- `console status` → watcher; system_status.py removed (2026-05-08, on `feat/status-watcher-default`): The dense curses pane (watcher_status_pane.py) is now the canonical `console status`. `--repo` / `--all` keep the text repo-snapshot path; `--json` dumps the watcher's `_collect()` snapshot for scripted consumers; `--watcher` / `--watch` aliases and the `console watcher` subcommand removed (status IS the watcher). `system_status.py` deleted in full — its budget/backend-caps/usage/resources helpers were already duplicated inside the watcher with the same I/O paths. tests/test_system_status.py replaced by tests/test_watcher_pane.py (collectors + allocator + CLI route assertions). test_pipeline.py system_status block dropped. docs/architecture.md tree updated. **Bonus fix**: roles section's auto-scroll was overriding the offset when collapsed, hiding the "Workers" header — now skipped while collapsed.

- Watcher: keep header visible when collapsed (2026-05-08, on `fix/watcher-collapsed-header-visible`): Scroll indicators (▲/▼) were overwriting the single visible row of a collapsed section, hiding the section name. Skip the indicator overlay when `collapsed[id]` is true so the header — including the ▶ marker — stays readable.

- Status pane: backend caps + per-backend usage (2026-05-08, on `feat/status-backend-caps-and-runs`): `console status` now surfaces a **Backend caps** block between Execution budget and System resources. Reads per-backend caps from `config/operations_center.local.yaml::backend_caps` and walks `usage.json` events to compute live counters: `hourly` / `daily` (execution events tagged with `backend=`), `in_flight` (execution_started minus execution_finished). Per-backend RAM threshold displayed as `ram≥<threshold>MB (free MB)` colored red when current free is below the floor. Layout: `kodo  in_flight 0/1  ram≥6144MB (2834 free)` — compact one-liner per backend with same yellow/red ratios as the global budget rows. JSON output gains `backend_caps` + `backend_usage` top-level keys. 4 new tests (yaml read, usage aggregation, JSON shape, missing-file fallbacks). Console suite still green; ruff clean.


- Curses pane: execution budget + backend caps live readout (2026-05-08, on `feat/curses-pane-budget-and-backend-caps`): The dense curses pane loaded into the zellij layout (`watcher_status_pane.py`) gains two new blocks between Queue and Services. **Execution budget**: hourly/daily counts vs env-driven caps with the same yellow≥80%/red≥100% color logic as `console status`. **Backend caps**: per-backend one-liner showing `h=used/limit  d=used/limit  in_flight=N/M  ram≥XXMB`; line color goes to the worst cap state (rate, concurrency, or RAM-below-floor). Three new data collectors (`_exec_budget`, `_backend_caps`, `_backend_usage`) read the same files OC enforces against — `usage.json` events tagged `backend=` and the `backend_caps` block in `operations_center.local.yaml`. Lightweight indented-block YAML parser added (handles inline comments) so the pane stays bun-free even on a bare interpreter without PyYAML — matching the existing pattern for the `plane:` block. 6 new tests; full pane test suite 17 pass; ruff clean.


- Curses pane: collapse + keyboard resize (2026-05-08, on `feat/curses-pane-collapse-and-resize`): Followup on per-section scroll. Each section header now shows ▼/▶ collapse indicator and a focus marker; clicking a header (BUTTON1 on the header row) toggles `collapsed_sections[id]`, and `c` keys the same toggle for the focused section. Collapsed sections render a single header row regardless of overflow. `+`/`-` adjust `size_mult[focused]` by 0.25 within `[0.3, 3.0]`; `=` resets. Allocator extended to honor both: collapsed → 1 row; non-collapsed natural = `ceil(len(lines) * mult)`. `_draw_main` now returns `(section_rows, header_rows)` so the click handler can hit-test the header row precisely (only when the section's scroll offset is 0). 4 new tests (collapsed→1, collapsed-during-overflow, size_mult grows natural, baseline still passes). Pane suite 26 passing; ruff clean. Mouse-drag resize was deliberately ruled out — fragile under zellij + multi-terminal mouse modes.

- Curses pane: per-section scroll + mouse wheel + CLI launcher (2026-05-08, on `feat/curses-pane-launcher-and-mouse`): The dense curses pane (`watcher_status_pane.py`) now scrolls each section independently. **Refactor**: `_build_main_lines` → `_build_sections` returning `list[{id, lines, sel_local}]`. New `_allocate_section_rows` distributes the middle area: each section gets its natural height when the total fits, otherwise proportional with a 3-row floor. **Per-section state**: `section_offsets: dict[str, int]` replaces the global scroll; each section renders its own slice with ▲/▼ indicators when there's more content. **Mouse wheel**: `curses.mousemask(ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS | REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION)` enabled; BUTTON4=up, BUTTON5=down, 3 lines per tick, routed by mouse y → section under cursor. Wheel events also set `focused_section` so subsequent PgUp/PgDn target the same section. **CLI launcher**: `console watcher` subcommand + `console status --watcher` flag both forward argv (incl. `--profile`) to the pane. 4 new tests (allocator natural fit / overflow proportional / empty sections / zero-available; plus CLI shortcut presence). Pane suite 23 tests passing; ruff clean.
## Recent Decisions

- Status pane: execution budget + system resources (2026-05-08, on `feat/status-budget-resources`): Two new sections in `console status` after the Watchers block. **Execution budget** reads OC's `tools/report/operations_center/execution/usage.json` for hourly/daily exec counts and shows them against env-driven caps (`OPERATIONS_CENTER_MAX_EXEC_PER_HOUR`/`DAY`, defaults 10/50). Color yellow at >=80%, red at >=100%, green otherwise. **System resources** shows process count + RAM/swap from /proc. RAM colored against OC's kodo dispatch threshold (kodo.min_kodo_available_mb, 6144 MB default); when free RAM drops below this OC silently blocks new kodo dispatches, so surfacing it explains why the budget might appear unmet. JSON output gains `execution_budget` + `system` top-level keys. 6 new tests; full console suite green.

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| docs/architecture.md refresh | Module tree updated to actual src/operator_console/ contents (not the old src/console/ path with missing modules); pane diagram updated to current single/multi-repo Zellij stack layout (claude/codex/aider stack, watcher status pane); session-tracking section rewritten to cover all three tools (Claude, Codex, Aider) instead of only Claude. | 2026-05-07 |
| WS architecture refs updated after subgrouping | WorkStation moved its architecture/ docs into adapters/, routing/, contracts/, execution/, policy/, system/ subdirs. Inbound README links rewritten. | 2026-05-07 |
| docs reorganization | Moved docs/migration/fob-operator-flow-update.md and docs/audits/final_rename_refactor_verification_2.md into docs/history/. Removed empty migration/ and audits/ dirs. | 2026-05-07 |

| README workspace-layout diagrams corrected (round 2) | First pass still drew shell/status as horizontally split panes; they're actually a Zellij **stack** (overlapping, switchable). Redrew center and right columns with explicit stack notation so the diagram matches launcher.py and Zellij's actual rendering | 2026-05-06 |
| README workspace-layout diagrams corrected | Single-repo and multi-repo ASCII diagrams + descriptions described an older layout (status bottom-left, shell as center pane, logs on right; stacked lazygits in multi). Replaced with current: lazygit | claude/codex/aider | shell+status (single); git_watcher | claude/codex/aider | shell+status (multi). Source of truth: src/operator_console/launcher.py | 2026-05-06 |

## Stop Points

- Wire Custodian B1 privacy block (2026-05-08, on `chore/wire-b1-privacy-block`): Added top-level `privacy:` block to `.custodian/config.yaml` listing `VideoFoundry` and `videofoundry` as banned literals. B1 reports zero leaks on the public surface — defaults exclude operator-private workspaces, history docs, and the config file itself, so the block is purely declarative for now and acts as a forward guard against future leaks.

- CI doctor: drop stale D7 exclude_paths (2026-05-06, on `main`): D7 (dead method param) was retired in Custodian's tool-first deprecation pass. `.custodian/config.yaml` still referenced D7 under exclude_paths, which `custodian-doctor --strict` flagged as an unknown detector. Removed the block.

- CI license header (2026-05-06, on `main`): Added missing SPDX header to `.vulture_whitelist.py`. Same fix pattern applied across other ProtocolWarden repos. CI license-header job now passes.

## Notes

_Free-form scratch space. Clear periodically._

- Fix title/divider/section spacing (2026-05-08, on `fix/title-divider-spacer-position`): The previous spacer landed *between* the divider and the first section, leaving the divider hugging the title. Operator wanted the divider hugging the first section instead, with the blank row between the title and the divider. Reordered: no banner → title (0) / blank (1) / divider (2) / section (3); banner → marquee (0) / blank (1) / title (2) / blank (3) / divider (4) / section (5).

- Global Gate row: shorten + capitalize (2026-05-08, on `fix/global-gate-line-fit-and-caps`): The gate readout was overflowing on narrower terminals. Compressed `in_flight` → `i-f`, dropped the `, ram+swap` annotation (the RAM and Swap rows above already explain free memory composition), and dropped the `config: resource_gate.* in OC local.yaml` hint from the (unset) form. Label switched from `Global gate` → `Global Gate`. New format: `Global Gate    i-f 0/6  mem≥12288MB (22000 free)` — fits comfortably in 80-col terminals.

- Stall alert covers all 8 workers (2026-05-08, on `fix/stall-alert-covers-all-roles`): The previous detector globbed `heartbeat_*.json` files and only flagged roles whose file existed but was old. A role that never started (no heartbeat file) or whose heartbeat got cleaned up was invisible. Rewrote to iterate the canonical `_ROLES` tuple: a role is stalled when (a) PID missing/dead, OR (b) no heartbeat file, OR (c) heartbeat older than 10min. Now every declared worker is evaluated each tick.

- DC2+DC4 fixes (2026-05-08, on `fix/dc-class-findings`): docs/pipeline.md cross-repo reference rewritten as a full GitHub URL link (was a backticked relative path the local file couldn't resolve, tripping DC2). README.md gains an Architecture H2 above Workspace Layout, and First Run renamed to Quick start to satisfy DC4's required-section pattern. DC count: 3 → 0.

- Banner restore title→sections spacer (2026-05-08, on `fix/banner-restore-title-sections-spacer`): The banner-divider PR #23 dropped the title→divider gap that the no-banner path keeps. Restored: banner case now ends with title (4) → blank (5) → divider (6), first section at row 7. Both code paths now read the same below the title.

## 2026-05-08 — Hint bar marquee on overflow (fix/hint-bar-marquee)

Hint bar at h-2 overflowed in narrow windows and got truncated. When wider than
window, it now scrolls in lockstep with the top banner (reuses banner_offset).
When it fits, renders static as before. No new state — same tick.


## 2026-05-08 — Multi-line collapsible hint bar (replaces marquee)

Replaced marquee-on-overflow with a wrapped multi-line hint bar that
defaults to collapsed (' ? hints (press ? to expand)'). Footer height
tracks the hint rows; flash sits one row above. Added '?' key handler.


## 2026-05-08 — M1: CHANGELOG.md stub (Keep-a-Changelog format)

Added a minimal CHANGELOG.md so M1 (and M5 format check) pass.

## 2026-05-08 — DC8: Move Quick start before Architecture in README

Reorder per canonical convention: What X is → What X is not → Quick
start → Architecture → ...


## 2026-05-08 — Custodian round: OConsole clean (39 → 0)

T6/T7 exclude_paths for src/operator_console/** (TUI exercised via CLI,
not name-imported in tests). T8 for test_architecture_demo.py (subprocess+curses).
common_words += git_watcher (subcommand name, not a Python symbol).


## 2026-05-08 — Title Case all status pane text

Banner messages, section headers, descriptors (running/queued/active/pending/etc),
hint chunks, action submenu, log view, and toggle indicators all Title Cased.
STOPPED / STALL ALERT remain ALL CAPS as severity emphasis.


## 2026-05-08 — CI regression guard

Added .github/workflows/custodian-audit.yml + .hooks/pre-push.
Both run `custodian-multi --fail-on-findings`. CI is the source of
truth; pre-push catches regressions before they hit GitHub.


## 2026-05-08 — CI fix: Direct URL pip install syntax


## 2026-05-08 — A_BOLD on ERR + YLW for dark-terminal readability

Plain red on dark background is nearly invisible on most terminals.
Bolding both ERR and YLW promotes them to the bright variants — readable
on dark + light alike.


## 2026-05-08 — Expand cryptic Backend Caps + Global Gate cell labels


## 2026-05-08 — Title-Case displayed values; rename Backend Caps → Backend Limits

New _tc() helper Title-Cases snake_case identifiers for display only —
data unchanged. Wired into worker rows, active tasks, recent activity,
board, queue, backend rows, action submenu, log view header.
'(no caps)' → '(No Limits)'. Action submenu items also Title-Cased.


## 2026-05-08 — Global Gate three-liner; Execution Budget → Global Rate (single-line); spacers + ≥ spacing


## 2026-05-08 — Reorder pane sections by operator timeline

Swapped board ↔ campaigns in section build order. Final timeline:
Workers / Active (Present) → Recent (Past) → Campaigns / Board / Queue
(Future) → Global Rate / Backend Limits (Capacity) → Services (Infra)
→ System Resources / Global Gate (bottom-anchored).


## 2026-05-08 — Bottom-anchored collapsible sections

Restructured the bottom of the pane: System Resources, Global Gate, and
Global Rate are now three independently collapsible sections, all bottom-
anchored. Default-open: System Resources only; Gate + Rate collapsed.

- Replaced flat _resources_lines() with _bottom_sections() → list[dict]
- Removed top-section 'budget' (Global Rate moved to bottom)
- Bottom render loop: spacer + divider, then each section header (and
  body if expanded), divider between sections
- Click-on-header / 'c' / mouse-wheel hit-testing all work uniformly


## 2026-05-08 — Fix Global Gate header DIM-when-healthy; expand load column headers

- Worst-cell tier ladder now picks RUN over DIM when at least one cell
  is RUN — gate header reads green when configured + healthy (not grey).
- '1m / 5m / 15m' → '1 Min / 5 Min / 15 Min' (clearer time windows).
- '(N cores)' → '(N Cores)' (title-case suffix).


## 2026-05-08 — Reorder bottom sections: Rate → Gate → Resources


## 2026-05-08 — Single divider directly under Services (drop spacer-then-divider)


## 2026-05-08 — Anchor inter-block divider to last top section


## 2026-05-08 — Restore leading divider on bottom block (above Global Rate)


## 2026-05-08 — Top block as virtual scroll buffer

When all top sections are uncollapsed and overflow the middle area,
the top block scrolls as a single virtual buffer (mouse-wheel + PgUp/
Dn). Bottom-anchored sections (Rate/Gate/Resources) stay put; the
top block flows behind them.

- _allocate_section_rows: drop proportional scaling, return natural sizes
- _draw_main: build vbuf from sections with dividers, render slice
  starting at top_scroll_offset, expose section_buf_ranges for hit-testing
- Mouse wheel anywhere over top sections scrolls top_scroll_offset
- PgUp/PgDn/Home/End now operate on top_scroll_offset
- Top block scroll arrows on boundary rows (▲/▼) when scrolled
- Dropped per-section scrolling for top sections (kept section_offsets
  signature for compatibility)


## 2026-05-08 — Drop top-block auto-scroll (operator-driven only)


## 2026-05-08 — Banner cycle buffer: leading pad + longer gap + 6s dwell


## 2026-05-08 — `x` collapse all + banner cycles after full scroll


## 2026-05-08 — Banner continuous-stream cycling (no hard cut)


## 2026-05-08 — Pin 'Just Started' banner to front of cycle (override severity sort)


- Status pane header layout (2026-05-09, on main): removed blank rows above and below "Operations Center" header (original rows 3 and 5); retained both separator lines; header now at row 3, blank breathing row at 4, sep at 5, content at 6. middle_top 7→6.

## 2026-05-10 — GitHub username migration

- Updated repo-owned references from the previous GitHub username to `ProtocolWarden` after the account rename.
- Scope: license headers, GitHub URLs, workflow install commands, manifests, dependency URLs, examples, and local owner defaults where present.

## 2026-05-13 — Add repograph/protocolwarden profiles; fix git_watcher columns

- Created `config/profiles/repograph.yaml` and `config/profiles/protocolwarden.github.io.yaml`; whitelisted both in `.gitignore`.
- `git_watcher.py`: name and branch column widths now computed dynamically from actual repo names so long entries like `ProtocolWarden.github.io` don't clobber adjacent columns.

## 2026-05-10 — Console setup and Custodian hook resolution

- Added non-interactive `setup.sh` to bootstrap OperatorConsole and symlink `console` into `~/.local/bin`.
- Updated the pre-push guard to prefer system `custodian-multi`, with repo venv and sibling Custodian venv fallbacks.

## 2026-05-13 — Add CLAUDE.md and .custodian/tmp*.yaml to .gitignore

- Added CLAUDE.md to .gitignore
- Added .custodian/tmp*.yaml to exclude custodian audit temp files
